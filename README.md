## Summary

I am dynamic and articulate data scientist with significant experience in big data and qualitative methods for over 15 years.  My professional path is a unexpected journey of coming full circle because of early intererest in data analysis. This research primarily focused on people and language.  I realized how momentous it is to combine big data with real human insights. Now I  see exciting ways to bring those  human insights together with a growing understanding of tech applications.
